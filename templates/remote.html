    A wikiurl is the unique portion of a wikipedia URL: everything that appears after "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" e.g. Jimmy_John's.*

<i>I started this project in order to teach myself a framework (flask) and port some code I had written into a web app which could be shared with others. This site crawls Wikipedia edit histories and returns a visualization of the frequency of edits made to a particular page. The frequency of edits made to a page are color-coded. Red signifies a relatively high number of edits in a month, green signifies a low number of edits, gray signifies either zero edits, a month that has not yet occurred or a month prior to the page's creation. This code was conceived during a project I did in grad school looking at the frequency of edits made to the Wikipedia pages of celebrities after their deaths.
<br />
<br />
What's with the favicon? Stay with me: the wikipedia favicon rotated 90 degrees looks like a sigma. Sigma is the summation operator. This code summarizes wikipedia edit data.

<i>Most inputs make the code barf (any Wikipedia page with ~1200 or more edits will do this). "Jimmy_John's" happened to be a parameter I used for testing which has few enough edits that the code works, but enough edits to show off what the code does.
  <br />
  <br />
 There are a few bugs: the links on each month only sometimes link to the appropriate edits, and the aforementioned crash from pages with high numbers of edits.
