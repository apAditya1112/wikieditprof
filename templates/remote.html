    Enter a wikiurl to profile:
    <br />
    <br />
    <form action="{{url_for('remote')}}" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="expression" />
        <input type="submit" value="Go" />
    </form>
        {% if result %}
            Results:

            <div id="result">
                {{ result }}
            </div>

        {% endif %}
    <br />
    A wikiurl is the unique portion of a wikipedia URL: everything that appears after "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" e.g. Vladimir_Nabokov.

<i>I started this project in order to teach myself a framework (flask) and port some code I had written into a web app which could be shared with others. This site crawls Wikipedia edit histories and returns a visualization of the frequency of edits made to a particular page. The frequency of edits are color-coded. <span style="color:red;">Red</span> signifies a relatively high number of edits in a month, <span style="color:green;">green</span> signifies a low number of edits, <span style="color:gray">gray</span> signifies either zero edits, a month that has not yet occurred or a month prior to the page's creation. This code was conceived during a project I did in grad school looking at the frequency of edits made to the Wikipedia pages of celebrities after their deaths.
<br />
<br />
What's with the favicon? The Wikipedia favicon rotated 90 degrees looks like a sigma. Sigma is the summation operator. This code summarizes wikipedia edit data.

<i>Because the code depends on http requests, which time out in 30 seconds, it is currently only capable of grabbing the most recent ~1300 edits. If you query a page with a higher number of edits, your results will display only the most recent edits.

 Bugs: This code is extremely slow. If you know how to implement background workers in Flask, or see any other glaring flaws in the <a href="https://github.com/mlincoln/wikieditprof/tree/beta">source</a>, <a href="http://mileslincoln.com">get in touch</a>.</i>
